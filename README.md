# üèÄ Predicting the NBA Most Valuable Player

This project aims at predicting the player who will win the NBA MVP award, by modelling the voting panel. The NBA MVP is given since the 1955‚Äì56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. Until the 1979‚Äì80 season, the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the 1980‚Äì81 season, the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters - more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award).

## Development

Run the web app locally : 
```pipenv run streamlit run app_web.py```

Load fresh data :
```pipenv run python app_cli.py --help```

Track models performance :
```pipenv run mlflow ui```

## Main challenges


#### Imbalanced data 

There is only 1 MVP per year, among hundreds of players.

Solutions :
- use MVP share instead of MVP award (regression model)
- use generally accepted tresholds to filter non-MVP players : 
  - more than 40% of the season games played
  - more than 20 minutes played per game
  - team conference rank above 9 (playoff qualifier)

#### Label consistency

A player winning MVP one year may not have won MVP the year before, event with the same stats. It all depends on the other players competition.

Solutions :
- normalize stats per season
  - min-max scaling
  - standardization

## Future work and model improvement ideas

- Rank stats (another solution for label consistency issue)
- Use previous years voting results (to model voters lassitude phenomena)
- Limit the players pool in each team to 2 or 3 players based on a treshold to define (or on another model)
- Add top performances or statement games as a feature
- The current model output may be a negative number. This is impossible in real life, since the prediction is an MVP share. Could we leverage on this information to force the model to output non-negative numbers ?
